For this problem, we will use a browserify transform to load a text file
and then we will apply some processing to the text file. Browserify
transforms are used to pre-process input source files into something that
browserify can read. For example, there are transforms for coffeescript
(coffeeify), es6 syntax (es6ify), and more on npm!

The text file you should read into your file is located at:
$WAKE_FILE

Use `brfs` to read that text file and print out the text file with leading
line numbers every 5th line with line numbers starting at 0, inclusive of 0.

You should pad the line number to 3 characters followed by a single space,
followed by the original line contents. For lines without printed line
numbers, print 4 spaces followed by the original line contents.

Protip: you can use the sprintf module (`npm install sprintf`) with a
format string of `"%3d %s"` to print the line number with the line in the
proper format.

For example, your output should look something like this:

    everybody ever he met, even sharing a precipitation under the idlish
 10 tarriers' umbrella of a showerproof wall, while all over up and down
    the four margins of this rancid Shem stuff the evilsmeller (who was
    devoted to Uldfadar Sardanapalus) used to stipple endlessly inartistic
    portraits of himself in the act of reciting old Nichiabilli's monolook
    interyerear Hanno, o Nonanno, acce'l brubblemm'as, ser Autore, q.e.d.,
 15 a heartbreakingly handsome young paolo with love lyrics for the goyls

With the `brfs` transform, you can load files with `fs.readFileSync()` and
the results will be preprocessed into an inline string. For example, if you
have:

  var fs = require('fs');
  var src = fs.readFileSync('beep.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(src);

and you apply the `brfs` transform, then after the transformation the code
becomes:

  var src = "beep boop!\n";
  console.log(src);

To turn on a transform, use `-t brfs` when compiling browserify and make
sure you install brfs with npm first:

  npm install brfs

Compile your program with `browserify -t brfs main.js` and pipe the bundle
output into `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` like this:

  browserify -t brfs main.js | $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify

If you just want to run your solution without verifying you can do:

  browserify -t brfs main.js | $ADVENTURE_COMMAND run
